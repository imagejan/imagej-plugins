Blind Experiment
================

This is a small plugin to assist with a blind analysis of image data.
Image filenames can be masked with random UUIDs. The UUID - filename
associations are saved in a properties (props) file. This file can
then be used to unmask filenames or results from the image analysis.

Usage:
------

* *Plugins > Blind Experiment > Mask filenames* to mask filenames before analysis
* *Plugins > Blind Experiment > Unmask filenames* to unmask filenames after analysis
* *Plugins > Blind Experiment > Unmask results table* to unmask labels of a results table
